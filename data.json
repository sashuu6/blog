He's obsessed with quality and I've had the fortune of having many productive discussions with him on improving my code quality and documentation processes.<br>As a teammate Sashwat is always brimming with optimism and his energy is infectious to others working with him. He has inspired me and other teammates to do better and lead by example. He's always interested in learning the latest tools/languages/frameworks, getting better at the stack he already works on and is always looking to expand his knowledge.<br>Overall, he's a great engineer and above all, a good person."
